# a-list-of-things-that-feel-good

* driving to get coffee
  * extra points if the weather is like 70s-80s
  * extra points if its after it rained and the sun is setting so theres the reflection on the road of the sun setting, its nice, its a nj thing i think

* going to the gym
  * watching older and younger people work out is pretty motivating actually
 
* having a years worth of a good habit, even a decades long habit, become useful in a random moment feels pretty good
